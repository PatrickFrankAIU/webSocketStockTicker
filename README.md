# Potential Improvements
Creating a "stockTracker" class to manage the WebSocket connection and stock data, and a "stockView" class that handles the user interface work, would reduce the overall code length of this project by maybe 15-20% through better organization and reuse of common patterns. It would also make the code more maintainable and extensible over time, because you could simply extend the existing classes rather than having to modify many different functions. 

That would be "a bit of a project", but would make an excellent educational "next step" following the ITWEB 300 course. Give it a try!
